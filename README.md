# Andrew's Portfolio

Welcome and thanks for taking the time to look at my portfolio projects.  As an avid stock trader and Data Science enthusiast, I am always working on projects to further my knowledge in both.  I enjoy working on projects that allow me to learn about new developments in machine learning/deep learning and practice my Data Science skills while finding new data driven ways to invest.  These projects represent a wide range of techniques from supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning to more traditional statistical techniques.
